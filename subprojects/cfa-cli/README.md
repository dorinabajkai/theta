## Overview

The `cfa-cli` project is an executable (command line) tool for running CEGAR-based analyses on CFAs.
For more information about the CFA formalism and its supported language elements, take a look at the [`cfa`](../cfa/README.md) project.

### Related projects

* [`cfa`](../cfa/README.md): Classes to represent CFAs and a domain specific language (DSL) to parse CFAs from a textual representation.
* [`cfa-analysis`](../cfa-analysis/README.md): CFA specific analysis modules enabling the algorithms to operate on them.

## Using the tool

1. [Build](../../doc/Build.md) the projects.
The runnable jar file will appear under _build/libs/_ with the name _theta-cfa-cli-\<VERSION\>-all.jar_.
2. You can simply rename it to _theta-cfa-cli.jar_.
3. The tool also requires the [Z3 SMT solver](../../doc/Build.md) to be available on `PATH`.
4. The tool can be executed with `java -jar theta-cfa-cli.jar [arguments]`.
    - If no arguments are given, a help screen is displayed about the arguments and their possible values.
    More information can also be found below.
    - For example `java -jar theta-cfa-cli.jar --model counter.cfa --loglevel INFO` runs the default analysis with logging on the `counter.cfa` input file.

### Docker (beta)

An experimental Dockerfile is also available under the _docker_ directory in the root of the repository.
The image can be built using the following command:
```
docker build -t theta-cfa-cli -f theta-cfa-cli.Dockerfile .
```

The script `run-theta-cfa-cli.sh` can be used for running the containerized version on models residing on the host:
```
./run-theta-cfa-cli.sh model.cfa [OTHER FLAGS]
```
Note that the model must be given as the first positional argument (without `--model`).

## Arguments

All arguments are optional, except `--model`.

- `--model`: Path of the input CFA model (mandatory).
- `--cex`: Output file where the counterexample is written (if the result is unsafe).
- `--loglevel`: Detailedness of logging.
  - Possible values (from the least to the most detailed): `RESULT`, `MAINSTEP`, `SUBSTEP`, `INFO`, `DETAIL`, `VERBOSE`
- `--domain`: Domain of the abstraction, possible values:
  - `PRED_CART`: Cartesian predicate abstraction.
  - `PRED_BOOL`: Boolean predicate abstraction.
  - `PRED_SPLIT`: Boolean predicate abstraction.
  - `EXPL`: Explicit-value abstraction.
  - _Remark: Predicate abstraction tracks logical formulas instead of concrete values of variables, which can be efficient for variables with large (or infinite) domain.
  Explicit-values keep track of a subset of system variables, which can be efficient if variables are mostly deterministic or have a small domain.
  More information on the abstract domains can be found in [our JAR paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-019-09535-x.pdf), Sections 2.2.1 and 3.1.3._
- `--initprec`: Initial precision of the abstraction.
  - `EMPTY`: Start with an empty initial precision.
  - `ALLVARS`: Track all variables by default (only applicable if `--domain` is `EXPL`).
- `--search`: Search strategy in the abstract state space, possible values:
  - `BFS`, `DFS`: Standard breadth- and depth-first search.
  - `ERR`: Guide the search based on the sytactical distance from the error location (see Section 3.1.2 of [our JAR paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-019-09535-x.pdf) for more information).
- `--encoding`: Encoding of the CFA during abstraction, possible values:
  - `SBE`: Single-block encoding, where abstraction is performed at each edge.
  This is just a reference implementation, `LBE` is always more efficient.
  - `LBE`: Large-block encoding, where sequential paths are treated as a single step for abstraction.
- `--maxenum`: Maximal number of states to be enumerated when performing explicit-value analysis (`--domain EXPL`).
If the limit is exceeded, unknown values are propagated.
As a special case, `0` stands for infinite, but it should only be used if the model does not have any variable with unbounded domain.
In general, values between `5` to `50` perform well (see Section 3.1.1 of [our JAR paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-019-09535-x.pdf) for more information).
- `--refinement`: Refinement strategy, possible values:
  - `FW_BIN_ITP`: Forward binary interpolation, only a reference implementation, does not perform well.
  - `BW_BIN_ITP`: Backward binary interpolation (see Section 3.2.1 of [our JAR paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-019-09535-x.pdf) for more information.
  - `SEQ_ITP`: Sequence interpolation.
  - `MULTI_SEQ`: Sequence interpolation with multiple counterexamples (see Section 3.2.2 of [our JAR paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10817-019-09535-x.pdf) for more information).
  - `UNSAT_CORE`: Unsat cores, only available if `--domain` is `EXPL`.
  - _Remark: `BW_BIN_ITP` and `SEQ_ITP` has the best performance usually._
- `--predsplit`: Splitting applied to predicates during refinement, possible values:
  - `WHOLE`: Keep predicates as a whole, no splitting is applied. Can perform well if the model has many Boolean variables.
  - `CONJUNCTS`: Split predicates into conjuncts.
  - `ATOMS`: Split predicates into atoms.
- `--precgranularity`: Granularity of the precision, possible values:
  - `GLOBAL`: The same precision is applied in each location of the CFA.
  - `LOCAL`: Each location can have a possibly different precision.
- `--metrics`: Print metrics about the CFA without running the algorithm.
- `--visualize`: Visualize the CFA without running the algorithm.
If the extension of the output file is `pdf`, `png` or `svg` an automatic visualization is performed, for which [GraphViz](../../doc/Build.md) has to be available on `PATH`.
Otherwise, the output is simply in `dot` format.
